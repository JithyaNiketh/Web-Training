DOM - Document Object Model - it is a programming interface in web dev that allows us to interact and manipulate 
the html document

When the web page is loaded, the browser creates the DOM of the web page

When an html file is loaded into the browser, the js cant understand the html document directly 

Dom is basically a representation of the web page but in a tree like structure.

HTML dom allows js to access and odify all the elements in the html document. 

in DOM all html elements are defined objects
Property: is a value that you can set to the objects 
Method: an action like add or delete
